"""Runtime-independent Memory core over one canonical MR Memory database.

This module is the reusable ownership boundary for tools that need canonical
Memory plus its local derived product projections without importing RuntimeBinding,
host composition, Body agents, retrieval providers, or LCE.

It does not grant new write authority. Canonical commits still flow through the
existing admission service; callers receive the same stores and invariants that
the bound MR runtime uses.
